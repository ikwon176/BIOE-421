# Status of Charge (SOC) Indicator with Circuit PlayGround

#### Bioe 421/521: Microcontroller Applications
#### Instructor: Jordan Miller
#### TA: Adam Farsheed

This project allows the Adafruit Circuit PlayGround to encode a numeric and alphabet value/word/phrase in Morse Code and decode Morse Code to output the correct numeric or alphabetical value or word. Using the encoder and decoder, the user can transmit a message as well as decode a message. Applications for these modules include the transmission of any data, such as through an epidermal interface.

In terms of hardware, this project requires:
  - 2 Adafruit Circuit PlayGround (https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-circuit-playground/overview)
  - 2 Adapter Cables (from the Circuit PlayGround to connect to the computer via USB)

The code can easily be adapted to other potential codes or languages. Currently, the codes contain separate functions for each dot-dash pattern and numerical value/alphabet character correspondence.

Integrated coding ideas/structure from https://gist.github.com/krobro/4eb81265cb09cc28a8c7 to create these encoder and decoder modules.
